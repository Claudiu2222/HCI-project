          GUD Boy is a project that aims to help people care for their dogs. The
          project will provide users with a platform where they can keep track
          of their dog's health, schedule vet appointments, and receive
          reminders for vaccinations. The platform will also provide users with
          information about dog breeds, training tips, and other useful dog care
          information. Also, there is a possibility to get in touch with a
          certified trainer for a personalized training plan.

        <div>
          <h3>3.1 AR Overlay pattern</h3>
          <p>
            This pattern allows for the overlay of information, images, or
            virtual elements onto the real world seen through AR devices, such
            as augmented reality glasses. <br /><br />Features of the AR Overlay
            Pattern: <br /><br />Real-time Information Overlay: While the user
            views the real world through AR glasses, information or
            recommendations can be overlaid onto the user's field of view to
            provide guidance and instructions in real-time. Interactivity with
            <br /><br />Virtual Objects: Users can interact with objects or
            virtual dogs present in the AR world, using gestures or voice
            commands to interact with them. Virtual Pet Simulation Pattern This
            pattern enables users to interact with a virtual dog in a simulated
            environment, experiencing different situations and scenarios to
            understand and improve the reactions and behavior of their real
            dogs. <br /><br />Features of the Virtual Pet Simulation Pattern:
            <br /><br />Simulation of Real Situations: Users can place a headset
            on their real dog's head and expose it to different stimuli or
            virtual situations to observe and understand its reactions.
            <br /><br />Real-time Feedback: Users receive real-time feedback
            about the behavior and reactions of their real dogs in relation to
            the simulated virtual situations, allowing them to understand and
            improve their interaction with their dogs. Virtual Training Pattern
            This pattern allows users to conduct virtual training sessions with
            virtual dogs, providing instructions and guidance in real-time to
            improve the training and behavior skills of their real dogs.
            <br /><br />Features of the Virtual Training Pattern:
            <br /><br />Virtual Instructions and Exercises: Users can access
            different training exercises and instructions presented in the form
            of virtual activities with virtual dogs. <br /><br />Real-time
            Feedback and Corrections: Users receive real-time feedback and
            corrections on how they train their dogs, allowing them to improve
            their technique and achieve better results. By implementing these
            design patterns in the Augmented Reality section of your
            application, you will provide users with an engaging and interactive
            experience, allowing them to experiment with and improve their
            interactions with their dogs in a safe and controlled virtual
            environment.
