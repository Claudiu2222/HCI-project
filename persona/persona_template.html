            <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
            <p>
              Meet Razvan, he is a digital strategist passionate about nature,
              music, marketing and data analytics, but also our primary persona.
              From the beginning of his journey to adulthood, he adopted a
              playful and lively dog, Django.
            </p>
            <p>
              In his busy life Razvan juggles between his job, social
              commitments and most importantly ensuring Django's happiness. As
              soon as he decided to adopt a dog, this came with an extra
              responsibility, but the most important aspect being its education.
            </p>
            <p>
              Razvan also took care of Django's training, documenting himself
              and watching videos on the Internet. However, he encountered
              difficulties in finding the right approach that would resonate
              with Django in different situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the appearance of the GUD BOI application, Razvan sees an
              opportunity to fulfill the ultimate goal of the dog education. He
              sees this application as a tool that not only provides guidance
              and feedback, but also one that fits the lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p>
              The lessons and videos on the platform will help Razvan to
              understand certain things about Django, moreover, interacting with
              other users through the application excites him, being able to
              learn from the experiences of other dog owners. One thing that
              Razvan sees as innovative is the part of AR integrated in the
              application, in which he will be able to interact in 2 ways. In
              the first part he will be made to act in different simulated
              situations with a virtual dog, from here he will learn how to
              manage these situations in real life together with Django. As for
              the second part, he will receive certain recommendations regarding
              the actions he takes on the dog in real time and not simulated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Razvan's goals with the GUD BOI app are varied. On a practical
              level, they hope to improve Django's behavior and address specific
              behavioral issues such as leash pulling and jumping. Personally,
              he wants to feel confident and strong as a dog owner, knowing that
              he is providing the best possible care for Django. From a business
              perspective, Razvan hopes the app will help her save time and
              effort in training Django, allowing her to focus on other aspects
              of her life and work.

          <h5>Scenarios</h5>
          <p>
            A first scenario of use can be that of documenting and reading
            articles predisposed to the application. In the first phase, Razvan
            will have to learn a little about dog psychology and some basic
            elements in training.
          </p>

          <p>
            A second scenario will be related to training a virtual puppy
            through AR, Razvan will need a headset through which he will do
            different tutorials in order to be prepared to put into practice
            what he learns when he faces situations similar
          </p>

          <p>
            A third scenario will be related to real-time recommendations that
            Razvan will actually receive based on the actions he takes on
            Django.

              reinforcement and building a strong relationship between the owner
              and the dog.
            </p>
            <p>
              Carlos has two big goals: make training simple and accessible to
              everyone and to be seen as an educator, not just a trainer. He
              enjoys his work and wants others to experience the joy of having a
              well-behaved dog.
            </p>
            <p>
              He has a strong presence on social media and digital platforms
              where he shares his knowledge and experience with dog owners from
              all over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Carlos says that there is no magic trick when it comes to training
              dogs, but understanding their behavior and being patient enough.
              Losing patience can lead to a negative experience for both the
              owner and the dog.
            </p>

            <p>
              Carlos realised that using apps can help him make the training
              process easier for the owners, as he can provide feedback and
              guidance in real time, while also being able to keep track of the
              progress of the dog and the owner. Being able to use tele-training
              is also a big plus for him, as he can reach people from all over
              the world. Seeing the health card of the dog will also help him
              understand the dog's behavior better and adapt the training
              sessions accordingly.

          <h5>Scenarios</h5>
          <p>
            Carlos could conduct a one-on-one outdoor training session focusing
            on leash manners, he can show the owner exactly how to correct the
            dog's behavior and give feedback in real time. The owner can also
            ask questions and get advice on how to handle certain situations.
            Carlos can use the AR feature to help a new dog owner who struggles
            with leash pulling by overlaying visual cues for the owner to
            follow. The owner will end up being more confident and the dog will
            begin to show improvement in its behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            During a training session, if Carlos notices that a dog seems unwell
            or not responding well to training cues, Carlos can open the dog's
            health card on the "GUDBOI" app to check if there's been a recent
            medication change or anything that could affect the dog's mood. He
            can then advise the owner to consult with a vet before continuing
            the training session.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a dog struggles with a particular skill, Carlos can check the
            dog's progress on the app and adjust the training plan accordingly.
            He can also provide additional resources and tips to help the owner
            practice at home, which will result in the dog improving this skill
            over time.
